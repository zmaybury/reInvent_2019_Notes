# ARC203 - Innovation at speed

What does it take to innovate quickly? In this session, we address how blockers to innovation, such as culture, skills, antiquated processes, and board-level concerns, can stand in the way of business agility. We map out a pathway to digital transformation, including new metrics for success, integration of real-world best practices from enterprises, and the most effective organizational patterns, as we integrate the business with development and operations.

"Cloud for CEOs"

## Old world IT (annual cycle)
- Marketing (TV + Radio)
- Sales (Brick and Mortar)
- Employees at work
- Factories and Supply Chains

## New world IT
- Online marketing and social media
- mobile employees 
- IoT connected things
- Online sales + delivery
- Factories + supply chain, continuous supply tracking, and just-in-time production

"Every customer you've ever had" not "every store you sell to"

Automation and "real-time"

## New Needs
- Personalization - everyones experience is different
- Customer Analytics
- New channels direct to customer
- More things, more scale, rapid (continuous) change

## Blockers for innovation

### Culture - leadership systems and feedback
- Centralized, slow decision-making
- lack of trust
- inflexible policies and processes
- "Teach them to yearn for the vast and endless sea." - Netflix
- "Use good judgement in all situations." - Nordstrom
- Netflix ![](./Photos/ARC203/IMG_1871.JPG)
- Amazon ![](./Photos/ARC203/IMG_1872.JPG)
- Culture
    - Intentional
    - Approporiate
    - Judgement
- Books:
    - _Ahead in the cloud_ - Stephen Orban
    - _A seat at the Table_ and _War and Peace and IT_ - Mark Schwartz

### Skills - Training and Compensation
- Train existing staff on cloud tech
- Fund pathfinder teams
- Be prepared to create incentives to keep the best people after training
- "Systemic incentive for employees to learn the next technologies that the company will need"
- _Powerful: Building a culture of Freedom and Responsibility_ by Patty McCord

### Organization - Move from projects to product teams
- Long-term product ownership
- Continuous delivery
- DevOps and "run what you wrote"
- Reduce tech debt and lock-in
- _Project to product_ by Mik Kersten
- _The DevOps Handbook_ by Gene Kim et al.
- Business, Product, Development, and Operations in each team ![](./Photos/ARC203/IMG_1873.JPG)
![](./Photos/ARC203/IMG_1874.JPG)
- Business
    - Budget, headcount, goals
- Product
    - Customer input, roadmap
- Development
    - Continuous delivery of features
- Operations
    - Automated global support
    
### Risk - Finance - Capex vs. opex
- Capitalized data center to expensed cloud
- Capitalized developmetn, expensed operations, to combined DevOps
- Plan ahead, don't surprise the CFO or your shareholders
- Boards - What is the role of boards in the long-term success of their company?
    - Compensation policy
    - Executive succession
    - Oversight of finance
    - Oversight of risk
    - Oversight of Strategy
- _Transforming Nokia: The power of paranoid optimism to lead through colossal change_ by Risto Silasmaa
- You get the culture you pay for
- Compensation policy isn't flexible enough ("Best practice" is low risk)
- Successful Board Patterns ![](./Photos/ARC203/IMG_1875.JPG)
    
## Time to value is what matters
- Do some work
- Time elapses
- Value to customer
- There is no economy of scale in software
    - Smaller changes are better ![](./Photos/ARC203/IMG_1876.JPG)
    - Need an automated continuous-devlivery pipeline
    - Tagging, feature flags, A/B tests
    - Rapid, cheap builds
    - Eg: Move from java monolith to Go microservices ![](./Photos/ARC203/IMG_1877.JPG)
- Change one small thing at a time
    - easier to tell if it breaks
    - easier to roll back to previous version
    - easier to measure time to value
    - Small Changes Summary
    - ![](./Photos/ARC203/IMG_1878.JPG)
- Best IT Architecture
    - ![](./Photos/ARC203/IMG_1883.JPG)


## How do we get there?
- Measure time everywhere
- Learn to do small things quickly
    - Create a fast path for simple and safe changes
- Iterate customer usability changes quickly
- Break huge project down into "fast path"
- Measure cost per deploy ![](./Photos/ARC203/IMG_1879.JPG)
